# What is Bandplace?

Bandplace ("A place for bands!") is a clone of the popular music streaming/band platform [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com). Users logging onto Bandplace can enjoy all of the core functionalities provided by Bandcamp, including (but not limited to) browsing an artist's release catalog, controlling music playback within the DOM, and creating and customizing artist storefront pages to look good and display key information.
